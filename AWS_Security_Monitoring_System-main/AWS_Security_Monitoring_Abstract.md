# AWS Security Monitoring System with Datadog Integration

## Abstract

This project implements a comprehensive cloud security monitoring solution that integrates AWS security services with Datadog for enhanced visibility and analytics. The system collects, processes, and analyzes security data from multiple AWS services to provide a unified security posture assessment.

### Architecture Overview

The solution employs a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda functions to collect security findings from:

1. **Amazon GuardDuty** - For threat detection and continuous security monitoring
2. **Amazon Inspector** - For vulnerability assessment of EC2 instances and container workloads
3. **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** - For monitoring web requests and blocking malicious traffic

These Lambda functions process the security findings and store them in an S3 bucket (`aws-security-monitoring-logs-123456`) as structured data. Additionally, a specialized anomaly detection Lambda function analyzes the collected data to identify potential security anomalies using statistical methods.

The system integrates with Datadog via an AWS IAM role (`DatadogIntegrationRole2`) that allows Datadog to collect metrics, logs, and events from the AWS environment. This enables real-time security monitoring, visualization, and alerting through Datadog's platform.

### Key Components

1. **Collection Layer**: Lambda functions that poll AWS security services at regular intervals

   - `guardduty-collector`: Collects findings from GuardDuty
   - `inspector-collector`: Collects vulnerability findings from Inspector
   - `waf-collector`: Collects blocked request data from WAF

2. **Storage Layer**: S3 bucket for persistent storage of security findings

3. **Analysis Layer**: Anomaly detection Lambda function that processes collected data

4. **Integration Layer**: Datadog AWS integration for visualization and alerting

### Implementation Details

The system is deployed using Terraform, which provisions all necessary AWS resources, IAM roles, and permissions. The Lambda functions are implemented in Python and utilize AWS SDK libraries to interact with various AWS services.

The integration with Datadog allows for:

- Real-time security monitoring dashboards
- Customizable alerts for security incidents
- Correlation of security events across different AWS services
- Long-term security trend analysis

### Conclusion

This AWS Security Monitoring system provides a robust, scalable solution for cloud security posture management. By leveraging AWS's native security services and Datadog's monitoring capabilities, it offers comprehensive security visibility across the AWS environment. The serverless architecture ensures cost-effectiveness and minimal operational overhead, making it suitable for organizations of various sizes.

The integration between AWS and Datadog demonstrates how cloud-native security tools can be enhanced with specialized monitoring platforms to create a more effective security monitoring solution.
